# QDR-SRAM  
The project focuses on generating multiple false target RF signals to block the enemy radar detection system. This is possible by using QDR-SRAM which generates multiple copies of recieved RF signal, 4 times faster than DDR-SRAM. This device increases the sampling rate by 1/8th of the sampling frequency. Multiple signlas povides multiple false blips which can jam the missle system.  
## This repository shows the verilog code for QDR-SRAM
