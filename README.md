# QDR-SRAM  
With the help of 5 stage pipelining, MIPs-32 microprocessor is able to execute instructions very easily and efficiently.   
Stage 1: Instruction fetch  
Stage 2: Instruction decode  
Stage 3: Execution  
Stage 4: Memory   
Stage 5: Write Back  
With the help of the above stages one can execute instructions arithmetic operations, logic operations, loops, read and write.
